    <p>A cupcake (also known as a fairy cake) is a small cake designed to be eaten by one person, baked in a thin paper
        wrapper, and decorated with frosting on top.</p>
    <p>One of the mainstays at Coffee & Cake is our famous Red Velvet Cupcake. A well-guarded recipe combined with the
        natural ingredients make this little red rascal unapologetically delicious. Topped with decorative vanilla
        frosting, the Red Velvet Cupcake is a favorite among kids as well.</p>
